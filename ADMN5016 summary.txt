Data set: Perfume Data Set

Description and Summary:

1. With the help of machine learning tools, we can formalize the Perfume Data. 
2. We can analyze various flavours of the perfume based on the number of times the measurement of odor meter was taken. There are a total of 28 values for each flavour of perfume with different values each.
3. By further implementing machine learning tools we can exactly formulate the total percentage of the above-said items based on the measurements and this 
   helps in planning what flavours to use based on a particular brand that needs it's scent to be of a specific type.
